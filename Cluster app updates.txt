Double-check sample size and include it everywhere

Check with Ipsos on geographic limitations (e.g. no Model Y in CA)

Make it two categories that can be selected: 1) Competitive set 2) Segments (all mid-size SUVs – e.g. VW Atlas, Ford Explorer / all fullsize pickups – e.g. Nissan Titan)

For the more granular graphs like attitudinal statements: always include full data (avoid data reduction due to clusters)

Add a description for the various graphs so that people can understand what they are looking at

For our 1:1 with Ryan next week: add a onepage summary of status, challenges, and next steps in the existing document we are always using

Mid-term task: find a description for clusters (e.g. tech-savvy EV loyalist for cluster 3)

Change model names to "Toyota 4Runner", etc.
